Read the attached cover letter and proposal and prepare a one to two-page summary of the proposed program using a standard 12-point font. You may use single or double spacing and bullets to summarize key points of the proposal but be sure to briefly summarize the program goals and answer the following questions in your review:

1. What problem is the program addressing?
2. What solution is being proposed? 
3. What are the outcomes of the program?
4. How will they evaluate the outcomes?
5. How persuasive is the proposal? Would you support funding it? Why or why not?

I will be looking to see that you effectively summarize the proposal, including the problem the proposed program is addressing, the solution, the outcomes, and how they will be evaluated. Include a brief rationale for funding based on how persuasive the proposal is as written.

Please proofread your writing for grammar, punctuation, and/or spelling errors or have someone else review it to catch minor errors you may otherwise miss. You may also find it helpful to read it aloud. Please put your name on the header and submit your proposal review to the assignments folder.
