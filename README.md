## Step 1 Develop Proposal Idea
Which programs are most fundable

new programs, or successful existing programs


begin with the end in mind:

70% program planning  
30% writing and packaging proposal

LOGIC MODEL  
-a valuable tool that produices a bsic pgoram picture that shows a how an org proram is intended to work  
-also hleps org outline seq of rrelated evetns in program  
-direct and visuall connection between program and desired results  
-design eveluation for a new program  


| Proposal Section | Review Question  |
|-|-|
|Proposal Needs Statement|What community need does the program or service that organization has identified address|
|Proposal Goals and Objectives|What would an improved community situation look like? |
| Proposal Methods |  What can the organization do to improve the situation? |
| Proposal Program Evaluation| How will the org know if its programs or service has suceeded?|
|Proposal Program Budget| How much will the orgazniation program or service cost what other sources of funding will it have?|
|Proposal Program sustainability| How will the organization program or service be funded in the future?|

## Step 2

Building relationships, harder than it sounds

Call the foundation,

Email the foundation, initiate contact

Letter of Inquiry  ( see example)

In-Person contact is unlikely

Review
1. Is the name of the program and amount of request clearly stated in the first paragraph?
2. Does the second paragraph elaborate further on the proposed project, as well as any related projects (when applicable)?
3. Is the organizations mission statement included?
4. Is the need the proposed program intends to meet clear? Are some preliminary data to support the need for the proposed program included?
5. Are the specific program outcomes the program is targeted to achieve described clearly?
6. Is program implementation included? 
7. Is the fit or natural connection between the oringazation program and the funders priority areas, as identified in their guidelines included?
8. If there is some funding already commited to the project, is it mentioned?
9. Is the programs contact person clearly identified, included all contact information? 


## Step 3 Developing problem statement:

- The need being addressed in the statement should have a clear relationship to the orgs mission and purpose
- Problem statement should focus oon those the organiztion serves and their needs, unless an organizational capacity-building grant is being sought
- Any asserts about the problem should be well supported with evidence, statistics, expert views, trends found in the experience of doing the work, etc..
- The organization must be able to directly connect, and substantiate, the need described in the proposal with the orgs ability to successfully respond to the need
- The problem statement must be easily digestible, Grants and charts with data are good addtions as they present the data in the most compelling ways

Tips for writing Problem Statement

- no more then 3 pages, be concise.
- use stats that are clear and document the current unmet need or problem. If talking about a community within a city, offer 1 or two points about the city, then zero in on the data specific to the community.
- Use comparative stats and research wnen possible. If possible, use data from a community that did something similar and cite the benefits that community derivvced from the project. 
- Quote authorities that have spoken on the topic, cite person and sources, add backup information that can substanciate that this is indeed an expert
- make sure all data collection is well documented
- use touching stories of poeple as examples, this tactic can be effective but only when balanced against hard data 
- give a sense of clear urgency of the request

Review
1. Is the proble mstatement focused on those who will be served by the program (and not on your org)?
2. Does the problem statemebnt directly connect to the organizations mission statement?
3. Given the organizations size and resources, can it address the problem in a meaninful way?
4. Is the problem statement adequately supported by solid and reputable quantitiave and qualitative data on the nature, size, and scope of the need addressed? 
5. is it sweet and simple ?(kiss)
6. Is the proiblem statement persuative without being weordy?

Reality Check
Avoid the trap of circular reasoning, which commonly occurs in problem statements. To use the Foundation Center’s definition and example, circular reasoning occurs when “you present the absence of your solution as the actual problem. Then your solution is offered as the way to solve the problem. For example, ‘The problem is that we have no pool in our community. Building a pool will solve the problem.’”
This statement does not communicate a problem: communities across the country thrive with no community pool. However, if it was stated that a community pool in the neighborhood would specifically address certain challenges the community is facing, and if followed up by citing a similar community where a community pool has had a positive impact in ways that are documented, it could potentially build a compelling argument that would provide the context for the problem statement.
The program’s need is now established. Developing the program’s goals and objectives is next, which is Step Four.
