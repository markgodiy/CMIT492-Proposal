Step 5
Developing the Methods
THE METHODS AN ORGANIZATION USES to reach its objectives are the focus of this step. Grantseekers look at the elements of the methods component of a proposal and learn how to use a time line to more easily see what will happen. Using a worksheet and examples, organizations can write their methods for the objectives developed in Step Four.

Purpose of the Methods Component
The problem statement is clearly articulated, and the goals and objectives are set. The methods component of the proposal systematically walks funders through the strategies the organization proposes to carry out in order to accomplish its objectives. Methods answer this key question: how will an organization actually accomplish its work?

Content of the Methods Component
Methods—also frequently referred to as strategies—are detailed descriptions of the activities an organization will implement to achieve the ends specified in its objectives. However they are referred to, this section of the proposal should clearly spell out the methods to be used and give the reasons for choosing them. Any research supporting the use of these methods—such as their previous success or, if the methods are untested, data that support the assertion that these methods might prove successful—should be included. This section should also address whether the methods selected are already in place within the organization and simply being replicated by the program, or whether they are new. Finally, this section should describe who will staff the program and their qualifications, and identify the client population to be served, along with a justification of why this population was selected.

To develop the methods component, answer the following questions:

1. What are the elements that are inflexible (such as date of completion, dollars available, staffing needed)?
2. What activities need to be carried out in order to meet the objectives?
3. What are the starting and ending dates of these activities?
4. Who has responsibility for completing each activity?
5. How will participants be selected? (This question is not applicable to all projects.)
6. How was this methodology determined to be the best one to solve the problem presented? Does it build on models already in existence, or is it a different approach? If it is different, why is it different? And why did the organization select it?
The methods section should be realistic—the organization should be able to complete the proposed activities within the time frame stated in the proposal using the available resources. For proposals with multiple objectives and methods, it is a good idea to include a timeline showing when each method will start and finish. The accompanying Sample Timeline for the Swim 4 Life Program shows one way to chart a nonprofit’s activities on a timeline.

Tips for Writing the Methods Component
Align the organization’s methods to the program’s objectives and problem statement.
Tie the methods to the resources being requested in the program budget. Each activity should match its corresponding cost exactly.
Explain the rationale for choosing these methods; talk in terms of research findings, best practices, expert opinion, and the organization’s past experience with similar programs.
Spell out the facilities and capital equipment that will be available for the project.
Build various activity phases on top of one another to move the effort toward the desired results. Include a timeline.
Be sure to discuss who will be served and how they will be chosen.
Do not assume that the funder knows about the nonprofit, its target audience, or what it proposes to accomplish.

Look over the Sample Methods Component for the Swim 4 Life program. Then develop the organization’s methods by completing Worksheet 5.1, which should list the key elements of the organization’s planned program. Finally, use the Methods Review Questions to review the organization’s methods in the same way the questions were deployed in the organization’s program statement and goals and objectives.

Sample Methods Component
Our primary objective in 2013 for the Swim 4 Life Program will employ the methods as outlined below. These methods have been proven successful as they are the same methods we used to launch our program at our current two school sites: Arthur Schomburg Middle School and the Rockmore Education Complex High School. It should be noted that Cooperville Middle School is located in Abbington, where Rockmore is also located, and we fully intend to leverage the relationships we’ve already established.
OBJECTIVE
To increase the swimming competence and confidence of the underserved youth in the Gathenton School District by adding Cooperville Middle School and increasing overall student participation by 25 percent within one full school year.
METHODS
Swim 4 Life program manager will recruit a point person on staff at Cooperville who has a specific interest in the program.
The Cooperville point person will work in collaboration with the program manager to
Create a small task force inclusive of the physical education teacher and a representative of the PTA
Hold a short series of meetings with the program manager, the Cooperville task force, and a point person from the Rockmore task force to share best practices, lay out the recruitment plan, agree on the evaluation plan and specific benchmarks, and coordinate schedules for the use of the pools
Create specific recruitment materials for the Cooperville site and update the general program materials to incorporate Cooperville as a new site
Host an Interested Parents meeting and separate Interested Students assembly at Cooperville, making sure we recruit and confirm at least five parents and students from the two other program sites to provide testimonials about the program at the meeting and assembly
Launch a time specific recruitment period targeting a minimum of twenty-five kids
Once officially launched, the program manager will formally chart the progress of each participant, noting the specific benchmarks along the way as established in the evaluation.

Methods Review Questions
1. Do the methods discussed in the proposal derive logically from the problem statement and the goals and objectives?
2. Do the methods present the program activities to be undertaken?
3. Has the grantseeker explained why they selected the specific methods or activities?
4. Has the grantseeker explained the timing and order of the specific activities?
5. Is it clear who will perform specific activities? And do their credentials and/or experience demonstrate that they are appropriate to carry out the activities of the program?
6. Given the organization’s projected resources, are the proposed activities feasible?
If an organization is following along with each step, including testing each proposal component against the questions at the end of each, it is now in prime position to be successful in the next step: developing the evaluation component, which is Step Six.
