Dear Ms. Wonder:
I appreciate the time Anne Jonas has taken to communicate with us about how our programs fit with the XYZ Foundation’s funding priorities, and the encouragement she offered us. Therefore, on behalf of the Board of Directors and staff, I am honored to submit this brief Letter of Inquiry introducing Swim 4 Life, an innovative swimming instruction program by Jane Swimmer, a former U.S. Olympic swimming hopeful and hometown hero. We respectfully request your consideration of a grant of $25,000 to help us expand our programs for low-income youth from two to three schools in the Gathenton School District.

Established as a 501(c)3 organization in 2008, the mission of the Swim 4 Life program is to empower youth in the underserved communities throughout King County through high-quality programs to utilize the discipline of swimming to improve physical fitness, nurture self-esteem, and acquire the confidence to advance their lives. This mission is currently being fulfilled through programs currently operated at Arthur Schomburg Middle School in South Spring and the Rockmore Education Complex High School in Abbington. More than 450 youth have participated since operations began, and we would now like to add Cooperville Middle School, also located in Abbington.

The need for programs like Swim 4 Life is enormous in the communities we serve. Swimming has not been a popular sport in African American or Latino communities in some measure as a result of various factors including access to pools and other safe places to swim. Historically speaking, African Americans were denied access to public pools prior to the civil rights movement—and after in many instances. As a result, this population turned to water holes, ponds, and other unsupervised alternatives, which led to rates of drowning among people of color that far exceed those of whites. For example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest report in early 2012, the drowning rate for African Americans between the ages of five and fourteen was more than three times that for whites.

Through a range of summer and after-school services, the Swim 4 Life program teaches children to be “water safe” and to swim, and prepares them for competitive team training if they want to further develop their skills. Our program at one school even provides swim instruction specifically for students with disabilities. Our partnership with the Gathenton School District offers us the opportunity to replicate the programs throughout the cities of Rockmore and South Spring in King County, contributing to improved health and fitness of hundreds of youth who have been excluded from the sport because of limited access to safe pools.
With your help, we will expand our program from two to three schools in the Gathenton School District and achieve the following specific programmatic outcomes with the low-income students and students of color we plan to serve in 2012:

- 100 students participate in water aerobics classes, which will enable nonswimmers to participate, since classes are conducted in shallow water
- 25 students are trained as Junior Lifeguards and Lifeguards, including seven at Rockmore Education Complex (a high school)
- 58 students participate on a swim team
- 37 students participate in swim fitness classes, workouts for students who already know how to swim and are looking for an exercise alternative as a part of a healthier lifestyle
- 13 students participate on a water polo team (Note: In previous years, we found that not one of our students even knew what water polo was until the program introduced it as an option)
- 29 students with Individualized Education Programs (IEP) complete the Adapted Learn-to-Swim class
- 39 students complete the Learn-to-Swim class

The outcomes listed above represent a 25% increase in the numbers of students we will serve.
Because of your commitment to encouraging low-income youth and young people of color to reach their fullest potential, as well as your geographic focus in King County, we sincerely hope that the XYZ Foundation will join us as our partner in this important program.

The Swim 4 Life Program budget is $468,800, of which $150,000 remains to be raised. So as you can see, your gift of $25,000 for the expanded program will go a long way toward helping us meet our budget. In addition, investing in Swim 4 Life will make a significant impact on the ability of economically disadvantaged King County, Any State, youth to create a brighter future for themselves. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (111) 111–1111. We deeply appreciate your invitation of this Letter of Inquiry and trust that you will see enough of a connection between our program and your foundation’s mission that you will invite a full proposal.

Sincerely,  
Shawn Jones, Executive Director
